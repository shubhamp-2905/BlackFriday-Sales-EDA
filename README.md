# 🛍️ Black Friday EDA & Feature Engineering

This project explores the Black Friday Sales dataset to understand customer purchase behavior and build a model to predict purchase amounts.

---

## 📌 Objective

Predict the purchase amount based on customer demographics and product details.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- ~550,000 rows
- Features: Gender, Age, Occupation, City Category, Product Categories, Purchase

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Men spend more than women
- Age group 26-35 are top buyers
- City B has the most customers
- Missing values in product categories handled
- Product_Category_1 has high correlation with purchase

---

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering

- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical features
- Dropped unnecessary columns
- Scaled features using `StandardScaler`

---

## ✅ Next Steps

Train ML models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to predict purchase amount.

---

## 📎 Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
